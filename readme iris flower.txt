Iris Flower Classification

Project Overview

The **Iris dataset** is one of the most famous datasets in machine learning.
It contains measurements of iris flowers from three species:

* **Setosa**
* **Versicolor**
* **Virginica**

The goal of this project is to **train a machine learning model** that can classify an iris flower into its species based on its **sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width**.

Dataset

* Features:

  * Sepal length (cm)
  * Sepal width (cm)
  * Petal length (cm)
  * Petal width (cm)
* Target:

  * Species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica)

Steps to Complete the Task

1. **Import libraries** → `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `scikit-learn`.
2. **Load dataset** → from `sklearn.datasets.load_iris()`.
3. **Explore dataset** → visualize with pairplots & check distribution.
4. **Preprocess data** → separate features (X) and target (y).
5. **Split data** → into training and testing sets (80/20).
6. **Train model** → Random Forest, Decision Tree, or Logistic Regression.
7. **Evaluate model** → check accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.
8. **Test predictions** → classify new flower samples.

Conclusion

* This project demonstrates a simple **supervised learning classification task**.
* The Iris dataset is a **great beginner dataset** to practice data exploration, visualization, and model building.
* Trained models can accurately classify flowers into their respective species.
